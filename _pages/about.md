I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de), working at the chair of [Software Engineering](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/se/se) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Lars Grunske]([https://example.com](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske)). My research explores the connections between code, tests, and documentation. I focus on generation-based techniques that use these relationships to detect and reduce inconsistencies, aiming to make software tools more reliable for developers.
